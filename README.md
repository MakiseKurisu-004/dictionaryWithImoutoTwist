# dictionaryWithImoutoTwist
A basic dictionary that uses a json file to obtain words and their definitions. This dictionary has been influenced by Japanese culture and a unique "å¦¹," or little sister, twist.
Please understand that I'm not good at programming, so I'm unable to make it so that the path of the json file would fit each and every person. So please go into the "komachichan.py" file and change the path to fit you.
